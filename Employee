We define an employee's total earnings to be their salary* monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. 
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. 
Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

Solution: SELECT salary * months AS max_total_earnings, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY max_total_earnings
ORDER BY max_total_earnings DESC
LIMIT 1;
